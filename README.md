# Lighter

A high level library of deep learning tools built on top of PyTorch inspired by PyTorch's Ignite  

This repository is primarily for my personal prototyping usage. You may find it useful or you may not.  

The ultimate goal of this repository is to unify my codebases so that I don't have to write much new code for new projects by writing more generic code which can be recycled and updated slowly over time with projects.  

Since this repo is meant to be constantly adapting to new models and methodologies, not all backward compatibility is guarranteed.  

Also since this repository is maintained by just myself and I've many other projects, this repository has limited test coverage and unit tests.
