    The class that holds everything together

    Parameters
    ----------
    loader: Finite iterator
        The loader is a finite iterator which must return a sample at each iteration
    closure: callable
        closure is a callable which executes one iteration of optimisation which called
        closure should return the statistics which should be tracked by callbacks in the form of a namedtuple
        Other formats may be used but a namedtuple should be used if possible for consistency
        closure should accept the sample as argument when called
    callbacks: list of callables
        callbacks should be a list of callable classes which handle statistics tracking and outputs of training/evaluation/prediction
        callbacks should take the output from closure, the instance of the Trainer which has it and the batch number as a member as arguments
